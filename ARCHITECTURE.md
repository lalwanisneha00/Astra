# Astra — Architecture

This is a living document. Update it whenever a phase introduces a new
architectural decision — don't let it drift from the code.

Astra's product goals, phase plan, and full spec live in the original
build prompt the project was kicked off from; this document tracks the
decisions actually made as it's built, phase by phase.

## Mission

Astra is an interactive, educational sky atlas: a fullscreen, dark,
glassmorphic web planetarium. It's built incrementally, one phase at a
time — see "Phase log" below for what's landed so far.

The product name is a placeholder and is kept in a single constant
(`src/app/constants.ts`) so it's trivial to rename.

## Rendering model

The sky is modeled as a **3D celestial sphere with the camera at its
center, looking out** — not a 2D projected map. This is the key
architectural decision behind the whole scene:

- Every celestial object has a base position in **equatorial J2000 (RA,
  Dec)**, converted at load time to a unit vector placed on the sphere.
- The **camera always sits at the origin** `[0, 0, 0]`. It never moves.
  Panning **rotates the camera's orientation**; zooming **changes its
  FOV**. It does not dolly forward/back or translate.
- This makes free 360° panning feel natural, keeps coordinate transforms
  (equatorial ↔ horizontal) simple, and means a future gyroscope/AR mode
  can just feed the camera a device-orientation quaternion instead of
  pointer input (see "Future seams" below).
- Stars render as a single `Points` cloud driven by a custom GLSL shader
  (`src/scene/shaders/`) so thousands of stars cost one draw call. Point
  size, color, and a subtle twinkle are computed on the GPU; twinkle is
  disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.

Folders with only a `.gitkeep` right now are placeholders for later
phases — the tree above is the target shape, established up front so the
architecture is visible from the start, per the project's build plan.

## State management

Six focused Zustand stores live in `src/state/`, one per concern:

- **`useSceneStore`** — camera FOV (current/target), hovered object id,
  fly-to target.
- **`useSelectionStore`** — the single currently-selected object
  (type + id), which drives which info panel is open.
- **`useLayersStore`** — one boolean per layer toggle (constellation
  lines/names, star names, grids, deep-sky, planets, labels, mythology).
- **`useTimeStore`** — explore vs. observer mode, the simulated
  `Date`, play/scrub state, speed.
- **`useLocationStore`** — observer lat/lon, permission state, source.
- **`useDataStore`** — per-catalog load status/errors.

**Rule:** scene layers must not re-render React on every frame. High-
frequency updates (camera orientation, per-frame shader uniforms) are
read/written imperatively via refs and `useFrame`, not through reactive
store subscriptions. `StarsLayer`'s `uTime` uniform is the first example
of this pattern — it's mutated directly in `useFrame`, never through
`setState`.

## Tech stack

Versions are whatever was current-stable at scaffold time (2026-07);
see `package.json` for exact numbers, don't trust hardcoded versions in
prose docs.

Not yet installed (added when their phase needs them, per the "touch
only what the phase needs" rule): `@react-three/drei`, `framer-motion`,
`react-router-dom`, `astronomy-engine`, `@testing-library/react`,
`playwright`, `vite-react-ssg`.

**Cost constraint:** every dependency and planned deploy target must be
free/open-source with no paid tier required. All datasets planned in the
spec (HYG, d3-celestial, OpenNGC, NASA fact sheets) are open. Hosting
(Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages, decided in Phase 13) must stay on a
free tier.

### Tooling notes

The Vite scaffolder's current default lint tool is `oxlint`, not ESLint.
This project explicitly uses **ESLint + Prettier** instead (per the
project spec's tooling section) — `oxlint` and its config were removed
right after scaffolding. Revisit if that turns out to be the wrong call;
oxlint is faster and could replace this later.

A `@/*` → `./src/*` path alias is configured in both `tsconfig.app.json`
and `vite.config.ts`, since the folder tree above is deep enough that
relative imports (`../../state/useLayersStore`) would get unwieldy fast.

## Future-proofing seams

These are architected for now, not built:

- **Camera** is already orientation-driven (rotate, don't translate), so
  gyroscope/compass/AR later just feeds it a device-orientation
  quaternion instead of pointer input.
- **`src/data/services/`** (not yet created) is reserved for future live
  APIs (ISS/TLE, exoplanets, space missions) — kept empty and separate
  from the static-catalog loaders.
- **Layers are pluggable**: a new layer is a new component under
  `scene/layers/` plus a boolean in `useLayersStore`. Meteor showers,
  eclipses, satellites, exoplanets each become a layer later without
  touching the others.
- **`useTimeStore`** is already the single source of truth for "what
  time is it in the sky," so future eclipse/meteor/mission timelines can
  hook into it directly.
- **Object model**: a future `CelestialObject` discriminated union
  (`src/types/`) will let stars/constellations/planets/DSOs share one
  `InfoPanel`, one search index, and one selection mechanism.

## Phase log

### Phase 1 — Project scaffold, design system seed, fullscreen scene shell

- Scaffolded with Vite + React 19 + TypeScript (strict).
- Swapped the scaffolder's default `oxlint` for ESLint (flat config) +
  Prettier, per spec.
- Tailwind v4 wired via `@tailwindcss/vite`; design tokens defined in
  `src/styles/tokens.css` via `@theme` (near-black/blue backgrounds, a
  soft blue accent, and glass-panel surface tokens).
- Fullscreen R3F `<Canvas>` (`src/scene/Canvas/SceneCanvas.tsx`) with a
  procedural starfield placeholder (`src/scene/layers/StarsLayer.tsx`):
  8,000 points on a Fibonacci sphere, custom shader for soft circular
  points + per-star twinkle (disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- All six Zustand stores created with real (if not yet fully consumed)
  state shapes matching the spec.
- `GlassPanel` primitive proves the frosted-glass aesthetic, used for a
  simple app-title header.
- `ErrorBoundary` wraps the app shell.
- One Vitest suite (`src/lib/math.test.ts`) proves the test harness.
